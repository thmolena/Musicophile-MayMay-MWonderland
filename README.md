Embarking on my Ph.D. journey at the age of 21, amidst the hustle and bustle of my everyday life, through the highs and lows of the road to my dreams, I carefully selected and cherished the finest photos, treasuring each precious moment. Now, these memories reside in Musicophile Maymay MWonderland—a Melodious Wonderland, a haven for my musical and magical experiences, all captured by me, @\_.musicophile_._maymay.\_ during her @\_.phdjourneyat21.\_
