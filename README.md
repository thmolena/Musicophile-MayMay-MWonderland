@\_.phdjourneyat21.\_ my journey from a secondary school student specializing in English at Tran Dai Nghia High School For The Gifted, 
<br> to a high school student specializing in Vietnamese Literature at VNU-HCM High School For The Gifted, 
<br> to a recipient of multiple acceptance letters to the undergraduate programs in English Literature in the U.S. at the age of 17, 
<br> to a recipient of a high school academic award in Vietnamese Literature in Ho Chi Minh City at the age of 18
<br> to a recipient of multiple acceptance letters to the Ph.D. programs in both Pure and Applied Mathematics at the age of 20, 
<br> to a first-year Ph.D. Student in the Pure Mathematics Ph.D. program at the age of 21
<br> to a Ph.D. Student in the Applied Mathematics Ph.D. program, still at the age of 21, as a result of me, myself, filling the forms to change my Ph.D. program from the Pure Mathematics Ph.D. Program to the Applied Mathematics Ph.D. Program after one full academic semester
<br> to a recipient of the Master of Science Degree in Applied Mathematics after completing my second-year in the Ph.D. program with a GPA of 4.1665/4.0000 (for the first time ever awww!)
<br> to a Ph.D. Candidate after me, myself, filling the forms to change my Ph.D. Advisor(s) for three times in two years to eventually end up with doing something for fun on the GPUs under the supervision of a Ph.D. Advisor who earned the Ph.D. Degree from Stanford University.

Embarking on my Ph.D. journey at the age of 21, amidst the hustle and bustle of my everyday life, through the highs and lows of the road to my dreams, I carefully selected and cherished the finest photos, treasuring each precious moment. Now, these memories reside in Musicophile Maymay MWonderland—a Melodious Wonderland, a haven for my musical and magical experiences, all captured by me, @\_.musicophile_._maymay.\_ during her @\_.phdjourneyat21.\_
