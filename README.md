"In my twenties, I only possessed two superpowers. My first superpower was getting accepted into multiple PhD programs at the age of 20, and my second one was working full time as a software engineer at NVIDIA while still maintaining my PhD Candidacy." That is exactly what I wrote in my Dissertation.

Below is the biography that I wrote in my Dissertation: 

At the age of 20, Molena received multiple acceptance letters and graduate assistantships from both the Pure and Applied Mathematics PhD programs. After careful consideration, she was honored to officially start her journey towards the Ph.D. Degree at the age of 21, as an incoming first-year Ph.D. Student in (Pure) Mathematics at North Carolina State University, which she fondly referred to as her most treasured and remarkable _.phdjourneyat21._

In depth, Molena’s most admired and honorable _.phdjourneyat21._ stems from her beginnings as a secondary school student specializing in English at Tran Dai Nghia High School For The Gifted at the age of 15. She then transitioned to become a high school student specializing in Vietnamese Literature at VNU-HCM High School For The Gifted, one of the top-tier high schools in Vietnam. At the age of 17, she received the acceptance letters and full-ride scholarships from multiple undergraduate programs in English and English Literature in the United States. At the age of 18, she received her final academic award in Vietnamese Literature, in Hồ Chí Minh City, Vietnam, before moving to the United States. Two years later, at the age of 20, Molena received the acceptance letters and graduate assistantships from multiple Ph.D. programs in both Pure and Applied Mathematics. To prepare for a smooth transition to the (Pure) Mathematics PhD Program, she also participated in the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program during the Spring semester of 2021. At the age of 23, she successfully completed her second year in the Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics, passed all required written qualifying exams, received her Master of Science Degree in Applied Mathematics, after finishing one of her most memorable semesters in graduate school, with a GPA of 4.1665 out of 4.0000.

Embarking on my Ph.D. journey at the age of 21, amidst the hustle and bustle of my everyday life, through the highs and lows of the road to my dreams, I carefully selected and cherished the finest photos, treasuring each precious moment. Now, these memories reside in Musicophile Maymay MWonderland—a Melodious Wonderland, a haven for my musical and magical experiences, all captured by me, @\_.musicophile_._maymay.\_ during her @\_.phdjourneyat21.\_
