Embarking on my Ph.D. journey at the age of 21, amidst the hustle and bustle of my everyday life, through the highs and lows of the road to my dreams, I carefully selected and cherished the finest photos, treasuring each precious moment. Now, these memories reside in Musicophile Maymay MWonderland—a Melodious Wonderland, a haven for my musical and magical experiences, all captured by me, @\_.musicophile_._maymay.\_ during her @\_.phdjourneyat21.\_ 

🌼🌸🌻🌼🌺: @\_.phdjourneyat21.\_ my journey from a student specializing in English at Tran Dai Nghia High School For The Gifted, followed by Vietnamese Literature at VNU-HCM High School For The Gifted (with an achievement in a provincial competition in Vietnamese Literature), to a recipient of the college acceptance letters in English Literature at the age of 17, followed by the Ph.D. acceptance letters in both Pure and Applied Mathematics at the age of 20, and consequently to a Ph.D. Student in Pure Mathematics at the age of 21 (later changed to Applied Mathematics), ending with doing something for fun on the GPUs under the supervision of a Ph.D. Advisor who earned the Ph.D. Degree from Stanford University following from one of my sweetest semesters as a Ph.D. Student with a GPA 4.1665/4.0000)
